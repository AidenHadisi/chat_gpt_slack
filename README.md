# chat_gpt_slack

A ChatGPT AI bot for Slack.

## DISCLAIMER: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
OpenAI has not yet released a public API for ChatGPT. This project calls the undocumented API using a manually obtained session token.  

You must manually grab your session token from cookies and add it to this bot. Token must also be manually refreshed. The bot is subject to aggressive rate limititing and other restrictions.


Once an official API is released, we will switch over to using the official API.  


This project is not associated with ChatGPT or OpenAI team in any way.
